# EMG-Based-Keyboard-Controller
For people with limited fine motor control–such as those with Parkinson’s Disease–tasks which require them to engage with a computer keyboard are often onerous, and potentially even impossible if the condition is severe enough. Beyond required daily tasks, those with limited fine motor control are also unable to enjoy fun tasks such as video games. This project entails a video game system which utilizes bicep and calf muscle contraction to play a video game, eliminating the need for the computer keyboard. The resulting system allowed the user to play their desired video game with minimal lag and a high degree of accuracy.
